# NSC-R TidyTuesday

A repository of R code used for NSC-R [*#TidyTuesday*](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) workshops. 

The [NSC-R Workshops](https://nscrweb.netlify.app/) is a series of one-hour online instructional sessions to support participants in developing their data science skills in R, and to promote open science principles. The NSC-R workshop meetings are organized by a team mostly affiliated with the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement (NSCR), but they are open to everyone, regardless of affiliation or skill level. There are workshops on specific topics (e.g. network analysis, missing values) and *#TidyTuesday* workshops that cover more basic skills and materials.
